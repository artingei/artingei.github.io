My name is Jonas Bergmeier and this is kind of my photographic journal. I am not a professional photographer but I do enjoy taking, developing and sharing photos of things I see day in and out. I use film exclusively. If you are interested in a print please feel free to contact me. This site was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/)/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/).
